Welcome to my blog. My name is Ivan Porto Carrero and I'm myself on a hitchhikers journey through technology.
This blog represents random thoughts and rants about some of that.

I've done some open source work, which you can find on the [projects](/projects) page.

Other than working on those open source projects, I also help the non-profit [Wordnik](http://wordnik.com) out with either
technical support or advise when they need it.
