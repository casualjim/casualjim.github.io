  <span class="post-date">Oct 25 2012</span>
  <p>It seems to me that every webframework in Scala, of which we have plenty, also insists on writing their own JSON library.
But various tools rely on the AST from lift-json.  This is both good and bad, there were a number of gaps in the lift-json version.
The most notable being that it does not support any other type than Double for representing decimal numbers.
A second problem is that because of the large number of dependencies in the lift project it typically is a bottleneck for upgrading to scala-2.10.
And thirdly it just seems an odd place for a nice library like that to live.
I&rsquo;m hopeful that more libraries like Play, Spray etc will contribute to this project so that instead of a fragmented json landscape we get a homogeneous one. All of them have a json ast with the same types defined in it.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve set out to set lift-json free from the lift project and tried to add some improvements along the way.
The first improvement I&rsquo;ve made is that you now have the choice between using <code>BigDecimal</code> or <code>Double</code> for representing decimal numbers, so you can use the library also to represent invoices etc.
The second change I made is to add several backends for parsing. The original lift-json parser is still available in the native package but you can now also use jackson as a parsing backend to the json library.
It&rsquo;s really easy to add more backends so smarterjson, spray-json etc are all in the cards.</p>

<p>I took a look at what play2 has in their json support and it looks like their main thing is a type class based reader/writer story instead of the formats based one from lift-json, so for good measure I also added that system to this library. In general I like typeclasses for this type of stuff but in this case I actually think that lift-json has a nicer approach by assembling all the context into a single formats object instead of requiring many type classes to be in scope at any given time when you want to parse or write json.</p>

<p>There are a few more convenience methods added on the <code>JValue</code> type that allow you to <code>camelize</code> or <code>underscore</code> keys, remove the nulls etc.
I spoke with <a href="https://github.com/jonifreeman">Joni Freeman</a> about the general idea of this library and he showed me what he did on a branch for lift-json 3.0 so I incorporated his work into json4s too. it basically means that a key/value pair used to represent a <code>JObject</code> is no longer a valid json AST node and there are some extra methods to work with those fields. All of this is explained in the <a href="https://github.com/json4s/json4s/blob/master/README.md">README</a> of the json4s project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also added support for json4s to the <a href="https://github.com/dispatch/reboot">dispatch reboot</a> project so you can use it there just like you can with lift-json. Furthermore <a href="https://github.com/rktoomey">Rose Toomey</a> let me know that <a href="https://github.com/novus/salat">salat</a> is now using json4s as json library instead of lift-json.</p>

<p>Some of the improvements I still want to make is for scala 2.10 I want to use the <code>Mirror</code> api to be able to reflect over more stuff than just case classes. For some of the use cases we have at where I work it makes sense to be able to use a few annotations (yes annotations unfortunately) to have certain keys be ignored and so on.  I&rsquo;ll probably steal some of that from the Salat project so that there is still some degree of consistency between our libraries.</p>

<p>I also want to figure out how we can possibly make the AST based approach useful with huge data structures, as it&rsquo;s not inconceivable to want to send 100MB or 10GB json docs over the wire. At that moment a lazy approach actually makes a lot of sense, I&rsquo;m open to suggestions on how this could be achieved efficiently without breaking the AST model.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re using json in scala consider using or contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/json4s/json4s">json4s project</a>.</p>
